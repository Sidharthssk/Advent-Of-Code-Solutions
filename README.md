# Advent-Of-Code

Hai🙋‍♂️ I'm Sidharth. I am from Palakkad Kerala. I am a first year student in Artificial Intelligence engineering.

Doing Advent of code and getting the correct answers for each day was a very joyful task. Moving on each day the difficulty level increased.

While doing Advent of Cord I only knew java and c++, but doing it with this language was a bit hectic for me. So i could do only upto Day-3
